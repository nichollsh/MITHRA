# MITHRA
A wrapper for stellar evolution models and tracks. 

MITHRA calculates stellar spectra, integrated fluxes, and other parameters using pre-calculated stellar evolution tracks and grids of stellar spectra.
This code is distributed under the BSD 3-Clause license.

All spectra are calculated at the surface of the star.

Pronounced: *mith*-*rah*. Named after the Persian god of light and the sun.
